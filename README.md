# Are Large Language Models Smart Coders? Evaluating Correctness and Efficiency of Generated Algorithms

The environmental impact of software has received increasing attention as part of global efforts to reduce carbon emissions and promote energy-efficient computing. In parallel, Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as powerful programming assistants, providing support for developers in complex coding tasks. In this context, this study investigates whether LLMs can correctly generate classic algorithms such as Heapsort and Binary Search across different programming languages. Additionally, we evaluate the energy, memory, and time efficiency of the generated implementations. Our results show that, in most cases, different LLMs are able to generate these algorithms correctly. Despite some variation, the findings indicate that LLM generated code is generally comparable in terms of energy consumption, memory usage, and execution time with human-written algorithms.
